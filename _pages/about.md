A data-driven Sports Analytics Blog
======
Most sources say that there are two aspects to sports analytics: Stuff that happens on the fields and stuff that happens on the field. For instance, tactics and player performance evaluatiin clearly relates to the on field area. Topics like merchandise analysis or fan engagement on the other hand are associated with things that happen off the field. 
I can understand where this division of sports analytics originates from, but I am not satisfied with it. There is so much more sports analytics can offer. Be it player scouting, sports fantasy analysis, player development, training control, psychological resilience, or trasnfer financial impact evaluation, the list for potential topics that can be realted to sports analysis is endless.
Further, as we are entering the golden age of blockchain and digitalization technology, I am convinced that we will see a outburst of new ways of collabrorating and engaging fans, stakeholders, and supporters with the game we love (article coming on NFTs in soccer soon).
