A data-driven Sports Analytics Blog
======
Most sources say that there are two sides to sports analytics: Stuff that happens on the fields and stuff that happens off the field. For instance, tactical analysis and player performance evaluation relates to the on-field area. On the other hand, topics like revenue development or fan engagement metrics are associated are clearly associated to events that are determined off the field. 
I can understand where this division of sports analytics originates from, but I am not satisfied with it. There is so much more sports analytics can and should offer to stakeholders of all kind. Be it player scouting, sports fantasy analysis, player development, training load control, psychological resilience testing, or transfer impact evaluation, the list for potential topics that can be related to sports analytics is endless.
Further, as we are entering the age of blockchain and digitalization technology, I am convinced we will see a outburst of new ways of collabrorating and engaging fans, stakeholders, and supporters with the game we love (article coming on NFTs in soccer soon).
