# Hello and Welcome

![passing_networks](images/main-passing-networks.png)<br>
 Do you want to see how data and technology is changing the sports we love? If so, then you have come to the right place. Follow along as I explore trending topics related to sports analytics, big data, and technology. New content will be dropping in every Thursday.<br>

## A Data-Driven Sports Analytics Blog

Most sources say that there are two sides to sports analytics: Events that happens on the field and stuff that happens off the field. For instance, tactical analysis and player performance evaluation relates to the on-field area. On the other hand, topics like revenue development or fan engagement metrics are associated to factors that are determined off the field. <br>
I can understand where this division of sports analytics originates from, but I am not satisfied with it. There is so much more sports analytics can and should offer to stakeholders of all kinds. Be it player scouting, sports fantasy analysis, player development, real-time training load control, psychological resilience testing, or transfer impact evaluation, the list for potential topics that can be related to sports analytics is endless. Hence, by not entering the stage of sports analytics clubs, but also players and fans, are foregoing unseen sides to the sports that move their lifes. <br> <br>
Further, as we are entering the age of Web 3.0 and blockchain technology, I am convinced that we will see an outburst of new ways of collabrorating and engaging fans, stakeholders, and supporters (article coming on NFTs in soccer soon). Therefore, if organizations, leagues, or even entire sports want to remain relevant, they will need to address how their status quo is going to be changed through these developments.

## About Me

My name is Malte Thesenvitz, and I am currently working as a Associate Consultant for Redapt Inc. in the Microsoft Azure and Power BI realm. I am a data analyst by traininig, with an MBA (2021), as well as an undergrad degree in Physics (2020), both from Seattle University. I am based in the beautiful Seattle, where I have learned to appreciate the long and sunny summers. I would lie if I say I'd love the winters as much. But I am getting used to it. But let's be honest, if you cannot stand rain, Seattle winters can feel like an eternity.

## Soccer Background

Growing up in Germany, Soccer (I actually dislike to not call it Football very much. But relocating to the States does not only have benefits I guess. When you are in Rome, do as the Romans do...) has been a central part of my life for as long as I can remember. I started playing when I was 4 years old, and quickly fell in love with the ball. I took it everywhere and played whenever I could. As I grew older, I played at a fairly competitive youth level back home for Hansa Rostock (Youth Bundesliga), but decided to try the jump over the little pond called Atlantic Ocean after finishing highschool to play Division 1 Collegiate Soccer at Seattle University to continue my education.
