What on earth does ethics have to do with sports analytics? Well you have all right to ask this question.

The answer is: absolutely nothing! But since this is *my* website, and luckily I can decide what to upload here. Today I decided to share some of my ethical reflections with you guys. <br> <br> Part of the reason for why I am doing this is because:

1. I enjoy reading up on contemporary important topics. 
2. I do retain information much better when I put my thought on paper.
3. I needed something to put on here (I know. Selfish me..)
<br>
<br>
Anyways. I hope you find the content engaing in some kiind of way. Please reach out to me if you want to rage about anything I misinterpreted. I do love me some **good old feedback**!
