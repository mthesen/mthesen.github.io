I have worked with the Microsoft Azure environment over the last 5 months. In this blog post, I will share my biggest takeaways related to not only Azure, but cloud computing in general. Specifically, I'll talk about:

* How to get started
* Good Resources
* Differences between coud providers

This list is not final and I will certainly append features to it.

# But as always, stay patient and stay tuned.

### P.S.: I know I have been saying this for a while, but we are close.
