Paul Pogba. Some love him (I'd say worship him), saying his skillset is as broad as it gets. Some hate him, arguing that he has been surfing on a wave of hype for the last 10 years. I think that disparity between opinion alone is reason enough to look at the French Midfielder from a more objective perspective. This piece is part one of a multi-piece series where we look at Paul Pogba and see what is true: Is he worth the hype, or his his skillset as average as that of Darron Gibson (Sorry Darron...)
