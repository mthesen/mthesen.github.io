Paul Pogba. Some love him (I'd say worship him), reiterating his skillset is as broad as it gets in modern football. Others hate him, arguing that goold old Paul has been surfing on a tsunami wave of hype for the last 10 years. I think that disparity between opinions alone is reason enough to take a closer look at the French Midfielder from a more objective perspective. This piece is part one of a multi-piece series where we look at Paul Pogba and see what is true: Is he worth the hype, or his his skillset as average as that of Darron Gibson (Sorry Darron...)
